What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?
The Rasberry Pi is using an external device to derive information.
What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?
The wiring of the sensors, the distance of how far somthing is from the sensors, what the sensor is sencing.
What role does coding play in this process?
Code tells the sencor what to do, it takes information from the sencor and gives it back to the terminal in the print.
